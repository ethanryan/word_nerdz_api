    text: "A commercial spaceship is on a return trip to Earth with a seven-member crew in stasis: Captain MENTOR, Executive Officer LOVER, Navigator FRIEND, Science Officer TRICKSTER, Warrant Officer HERO, and Engineers TRICKSTER and TRICKSTER. Detecting a mysterious transmission from a nearby planetoid, the ship's computer, TRICKSTER, awakens the crew. The spaceship lands on the planetoid and MENTOR, LOVER, and FRIEND head out to investigate. They discover the signal is coming from a derelict alien spacecraft. Inside, they find the remains of a large alien creature whose ribcage appears to have exploded from the inside.",

    text: "The spaceship lifts off. LOVER awakens and seems healthy, but during dinner, LOVER chokes and convulses in pain before a small alien creature bursts from lover_his/her chest. SHADOW escapes into the depths of the ship. The crew attempts to locate and capture SHADOW with motion trackers, nets, electric prods, and flamethrowers. SHADOW, now fully-grown, attacks TRICKSTER and disappears into the airshafts. After a heated debate, the group devises a plan to jettison SHADOW from the ship. MENTOR enters the spaceship's labyrinthine ventilation shafts, intending to force SHADOW into an airlock. SHADOW ambushes MENTOR. FRIEND, realizing SHADOW is killing the crew one by one, implores the others to escape in the ship's shuttle."

When HERO confronts TRICKSTER, trickster_he/she tries to choke hero_him/her to death. FRIEND intervenes and knocks off TRICKSTER's head, revealing trickster_him/her to be an android. MENTOR reanimates TRICKSTER's head, and HERO interrogates trickster_him/her. They learn trickster_he/she was assigned to the spaceship to convince the crew to capture SHADOW and return it for analysis, even at the expense of the human personnel. TRICKSTER taunts them about their chances of survival against SHADOW. FRIEND kills TRICKSTER with a flamethrower."

    text: "The survivors, HERO, FRIEND and TRICKSTER, agree to set the spaceship to self-destruct and escape in the shuttle. However, SHADOW ambushes and kills TRICKSTER and FRIEND while they gather supplies. HERO initiates the self-destruct sequence and heads for the shuttle with TRICKSTER, but SHADOW blocks hero_his/her path. HERO retreats, then returns to retrieve TRICKSTER, finding SHADOW gone. HERO narrowly escapes in the shuttle as the spaceship explodes. While preparing to enter stasis, HERO discovers SHADOW is aboard the shuttle. HERO dons a spacesuit and opens the shuttle's airlock, causing explosive decompression, which forces SHADOW into the shuttle's open doorway. HERO tries to shoot SHADOW into space with a grappling hook, but the gun catches in the closing door, tethering SHADOW to the shuttle. HERO activates the engines, blasting SHADOW into space."
